**Don't Pester Your Customer** — Bitcoin Lightning micropayments for MCP servers.

> Under Construction

Tollbooth is a Python library that adds Bitcoin Lightning micropayment gating to any [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server. Users purchase credits via Lightning invoices, and each tool call is debited from their balance. Operators collect revenue; the framework collects a small royalty on all commerce.

## Reference Integration

[thebrain-mcp](https://github.com/lonniev/thebrain-mcp) — the first MCP server powered by Tollbooth.
